well, not quite yet. i still need to actually push a git commit and *then* push the site
to neocities. and then hope that nothing breaks in the process. but the finish line is
so, so close! for reference, i started this project around this time last year, but
was too busy to actually get any progress made. at the time i was still using windows
on my home setup, so i had to use wsl to work with jekyll, which was unbelievably janky.
i also have a profound habit of distro-hopping, but in a way where i 
regularly just wipe my drives in the process,
so the original files are all very much gone. but anyway,
now i'm *!!unemployed!!* and running mxfb on my laptop, so 
i've got plenty of time and working with hugo was a bit
of a smoother process. i still need to figure out how to make the rss and sitemap
xml pages not look like shit. or are they supposed to look like shit? i don't know.
i think i'm too young to know how rss feeds work. i also need to fix an issue with the
custom cursors where hovering over a hyperlinked image doesn't give you the
hyperlink pointer. annoyinggggggggggg.
  
well, if you're reading this, then hopefully everything has gone without a hitch.
i hope you're all having a good week. i know i did! i made yogurt and everything!
may this be a strong step forward in the journey of this blog. or something.
