hey there. welcome to my "web" "page". i created
this site both as a fun little coding project and because being on any
type of modern social media for too long makes me want to
blow my brains out for real. this place looks the way it does
partially for nostalgic reasons, but also because i think there
is something so charming about making something that looks kind of
ugly. this thing is utterly unmarketable, and ultimately, isn't that what being
punk's all about #downWithCapitalism. anyway,
consider this a place you can read my thoughts, vomited out without
any regard to whether it will gain "likes" or "comments," if, for
some reason, you would like to do that.
i may also be dipping my toes into gamedev soon, in which case, this place will
act as a sort of landing pad for that. (note: i wrote this around 3 am
and coming back to this, i don't know what i meant by "landing pad"?
is that a thing people say? whatever.) i don't know man. just join me for the ride.
i don't feel like adding my contact information or
figuring out how to implement guestbooks/chatboxes, so if you don't already
know me and want to talk, reach out to me on github, i guess.
let's party.
