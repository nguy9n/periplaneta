hey there. welcome to **the periplaneta planet**. i created this place
both as a fun little coding project and because being on any type of
modern social media for too long makes me want to blow my brains out
for real. my desire is for **the periplaneta planet** to embody the geocities
spirit of having fun and making whatever the fuck i want without
thinking about getting "likes" or "comments". it's also got that
"kind of ugly," "doesn't really know how to code" endearing swag. not entirely
sure what'll end up here aside from word-vomit personal blog posts, but i might
end up venturing into (really small-scale, janky) gamedev, in which
case i'll post about that here, too. feel free to join me in this journey.
don't feel like adding contact information or figuring out how to implement
a chatbox or guestbook, so if you'd like to reach out to me, shoot me a message
on github. enjoy your stay here!
