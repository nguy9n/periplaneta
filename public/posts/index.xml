      <description>on saturday, my blood pressure dropped out of nowhere and i passed out, twice, hitting my face, hard, onto the kitchen floor, bruising my zygomatic in the process. i may have had a concussion - it was way too bright when i walked to the grocery store, suggesting my pupils weren&amp;rsquo;t constricting properly? anyway - on sunday, i developed my first roll of film.&#xA;it was a roll i&amp;rsquo;ve had for a while now - of the cheapest 35mm film you can find at your local superstore: fujicolor superia 400 - and it expired back in june 2019.</description>

      <description>well, not quite yet. i still need to actually push a git commit and then push the site to neocities. and then hope that nothing breaks in the process. but the finish line is so, so close! for reference, i started this project around this time last year, but was too busy to actually get any progress made. at the time i was still using windows on my home setup, so i had to use wsl to work with jekyll, which was unbelievably janky.</description>
