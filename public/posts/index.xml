      <description>well, not quite yet. i still need to actually push a git commit and then push the site to neocities. and then hope that nothing breaks in the process. but the finish line is so, so close! for reference, i started this project around this time last year, but was too busy to actually get any progress made. at the time i was still using windows on my home setup, so i had to use wsl to work with jekyll, which was unbelievably janky.</description>
