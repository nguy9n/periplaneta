 <h1>2024-09-10 <br> haha whoops six months later</h1>
 <p>currently listening 2!!! <em>Quietly Now! Liver! Lung! Fr!</em>
the frightened rabbit live album from 2008. been listening to a lot
of frightened rabbit this year - and, consequently, been thinking a lot
about scott hutchison, which may or may not be concerning.
live albums are a gem, btw, and i think we should
have more of them, as a society. and albums in general. music! :+)
especially love <em>Quietly Now! Liver! Lung! Fr!</em> - scott is such a great
performer &amp; perhaps selfishly, all my favorite FR songs are on it.
i did not mean to start this off by talking at length about FR, but alas.</p>
<p><em>you&rsquo;re the shit and i&rsquo;m knee deep in it</em></p>
<p><em>i think i&rsquo;ll save suicide for another day</em></p>
<p>this is not a good start to a blogpost, i think, but i will justify
it by claiming to replicate the je ne sais quois of a 2000s blogpost.
(like i would know.) i actually spent most of my time listening to
the aforementioned FR live album
(as well as radiator hospital&rsquo;s <em>Something Wild</em>)
while figuring out how to use git and hugo
again (you would think i would, eventually, remember how to set up git on
new OS installs since i do it so often, but no. thank you,
<a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/07-github.html">software carpentry</a>,
for continuously saving my ass on this.) (i use too many parentheses.)
it is very strange to think that six months has passed
since my last post about caffenol. i keep meaning to ~blog more~ but
find my life to be dreadfully boring &amp; assume no one wants to read about
my inane thoughts. i did, however, start this project with the intention,
somewhat, of mostly blogging for myself. of keeping longform Poasting alive,
regardless of other&rsquo;s opinions on the mundaneness of what i&rsquo;ve to say.
i&rsquo;ve said before that mundanity is what makes life worth living sometimes, anyway.
i&rsquo;ve learned to really love talking about the weather with strangers lately.
plus, i always tell other people to get into website-making &amp; blogposting,
and i&rsquo;d hate to be a hypocrite. (you, too, can do this! and should! because i am!)</p>
<p>well. what has happened in the past six months. i don&rsquo;t know. i don&rsquo;t remember.
i&rsquo;ve been employed since april, which is fun, but i find myself really
missing school and research, though, hold on i have a tweet for this
yes it&rsquo;s a tumblr image embed shut up</p>
<p><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/967cae7615d234682b0965d8392f654e/5305b2f694f9c92a-3d/s1280x1920/b94b5233c8880870b47d1224284a5aeafea64987.jpg" alt="tweet by sophia @pastoralcomical: (inside the torture sphere) wth this sucks.
i hate the torture sphere (outsite the torture sphere) ok now that i think about it,
the torture sphere has a sort of &ldquo;je ne sais quois&rdquo;" title="the jennies.."></p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t have anything else to say about my life okay let&rsquo;s move on</p>
<p>the bell riots of 2024 as predicted by star trek: deep space nine passed just
last week, in the first few days of september. i thought about making a blogpost for
the occassion - to talk about how sci-fi uses its genre-ness and its pretense
of talking about a distant future to discuss sociopolitical issues happening in the present.
but then i forgot to. and now it feels too late to. sorry! i did recently watch
angela collier&rsquo;s <a href="https://youtu.be/MdLHKdn0JTY?si=etGClAFhJ4MASzsi">video</a> on star trek: picard
and how it sucks and it&rsquo;s such a wonderfully funny video and made me think about
how criminal minds: evolution, which is also on paramount+, also sucks so fucking bad
in exactly the same ways. um. anyway</p>
<p>i was originally going to just make a blogpost about the wild west that is fragrantica
reviews, but i think i needed to get back into the ~flow~ of things by reinstalling
git and hugo and just making a good ol&rsquo; update post first. i hope you can forgive
the meandering, listlessness of this one. oh also reminder for leo in the future
because he is definitely going to wipe an OS install somewhere and have to reinstall
git and go and hugo: the debian repository package for hugo is out of date (as are most
debian packages hahahaha!!!) install from the prebuilt binary you stupid piece of shit.</p>
<p>i hope to have another one (probably the fragrantica post) out on here soon. potentially
sooner than another six months. until then, watch out for the world. if you&rsquo;ve,
for whatever godforsaken reason, taken time out of your day to read this, thanks.
love you. take care of yourself.</p>
