      <description>well, not quite yet. i still need to actually push a git commit and then push the site to neocities. and then hope that nothing breaks in the process. but the finish line is so, so close! for reference, i started this project around this time last year, but was too busy to actually get any progress made. at the time i was still using windows on my home setup, so i had to use wsl to work with jekyll, which was unbelievably janky.</description>

      <description>about the webmaster howdy! my name is leonardo, and i&amp;rsquo;m the person who runs this monstrosity. the bulk of my experience with html and css was with the &amp;ldquo;about me&amp;rdquo; creation gui of fanfiction/quiz website quotev dot com back in the early-mid 2010s, so i&amp;rsquo;m practically an expert at web design. when i was in middle school, i took a java class online and hated it so much that i swore i would never touch a piece of code again, but it turns out coding is kind of fun when you&amp;rsquo;re doing it for completely inconsequential bullshit.</description>
